## Project Description 📋

This NoSQL workout tracker was designed to showcase my knowledge of [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/es/cloud/atlas) and [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) deployment. This application allows the user to track and save their exercise routine so they can manage their workout routine. The final part of the project was setting up the [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) database connection with [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/es/cloud/atlas/register) and having all the desired functionality on the deployed link.
